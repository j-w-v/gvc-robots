Allow users to input the instructions themselves
Store instructions differently
    - This would allow for different traverals methods over the instructions.
    - I'm not keen on splitting the string to read instructions, though I would need more time to research a better method.
As a FrontEnd Dev I would have liked to implement it in React. This could of had a visual grid which showed the robot movement and direction.
